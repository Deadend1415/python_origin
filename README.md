# python_origin
 -origin:
 My first python completed project.
 It reads the number in the file "origin_file.txt"
 Then it increments it by one and writes the new value back to "origin_file.txt"
 -find&delete:
 It first creates a list of all the files in the directory 
 Checks if a character is in the name of any of the files then deletes it
